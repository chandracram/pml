pml- this is an exercise based on practical machine course on Coursera by John Hopkins university
https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn 

The dataset used in this exercise is taken from 
WLE Dataset: Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013

Objective:  
1. Build a machine learning algorithm to predict activity quality from activity monitors
2. the out of sample error to be and estimate the error appropriately with cross-validation?

This repository try to provide solution to above objective
